The main goal of this project is to build a working implementation of a family tree program. It is worth noting that when I first started this project, I was working with C, then I started writing C++ code to take care of the SDL/graphics side of things. And now after my experience with Java, I feel it would be a good idea to migrate the whole project to Java. 

I'm thinking of having a contact class, and then a class that logically organizes the contacts, a class that sets up and handles the GUI, and a main class that initializes everything.
